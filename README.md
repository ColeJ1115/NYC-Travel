# NYC-Travel
This is our final Data  Analytics project from Grand Circuis

My group consisted of Rodrigo Zegarra, Clay Parker, and I Michael 'Cole' Jenkins.
We originally started to analyze transportation across the world which wound up being too broad with not enough global data in the given time we had. We then pivoted to look at travel and flight data across the US but then ran into a similar issue. Finally, we narrowed it down to travel data to NYC. We then analyzed the main factors people look at when considering traveling to another location. To see more into our data report please view the pdf.
